# JSON_MySQL_Store
revision to another app on this site with SQL commands for AVG, COUNT 

Table is compiled by data from a database table in MySQL, and is also recorded in a data.json file. SQL queries to get the AVG and the COUNT on the index.php page calculate the numbers respectively. 

****1st entry must be a dummy entry with '0' as the 'cost' entry for the database, since entry 0 is not appearing on the database, yet is affecting the 'average' and the 'cost' outputs at the bottom of the table.
